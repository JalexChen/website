<!-- 

"Ohana is a full-stack management tool that abstracts Kubernetess workflow for engineering and DevOps teams by giving developers the freedom to create self-service namespaces and virtual clusters on-demand through RBAC, which improves deployment times, decreases costs, and allows for multi-tenancy within a cluster." -->

Ohana is desgigned to seamlessly integrate into your Kubernetes workflow by breaking the barriers between DevOps and Developers; keeping sensitive data apart from developers who need to work on the existing codebase and allowing operations to focus solely on the stability of the Cluster and managing container load. While there are paid products that exist to do this for you, Ohana offers this at no cost and provides a barebones platform that allows you to create virtual clusters, namespaces, and streamline independent workflows all within a designated cluster through Role Based Access Control (RBAC). 

Additionally, much of the workflow is abstracted, allowing developers to interface with a GUI, rather than work through the command line in order to get their namespace up and running.

Ohana allows you to build a bespoke Internal Kubernetes Platform tailored to your company's needs at scale, providing the modularity needed to solve your business problems at a speed and a cost effectiveness suited to your specifications.

Our Platform Generates:
- Cost Savings - the closest competitor costs $20/user
- Decreased Deployment Times - Self service models deploy 85% faster*
- Independent Workflows - Creation of a separate virtual cluster results in fewer tickets
- Less Fricton Between Teams - Redefines roles and allows DevOps to focus on stability and Developers to focus on the code
- Increseased Productiviy - The more work accomplished, the better the bottom line
