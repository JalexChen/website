# Why Use Us? 

**Why pay more for the same thing? Ohana offers the same functionality included within paid services like Loft and packages it with an open source platform, allowing your team to customize and scale to your company's needs.**

- Flexibility: Because we are open source and barebones, functionality is ultiately decided by your needs
- Bloat: We offer the bare-bones essentials to create and deploy with simple clicks. Onboarding employees has never been easier
- Simplicity: Our UI is simple, intuitive, and abstracts the difficulties of learning the Kubernetes platforms to get your developer teams running quicker - faster
