# Welcome to the Family

Ohana is designed to seamlessly integrate into your Kubernetes workflow by breaking the barriers between DevOps and Developers; keeping sensitive data apart from developers who need to work on the existing codebase and allowing operations to focus solely on the stability of the Cluster and managing container load. While there are paid products that exist to do this for you, Ohana offers this at no cost and provides a bare-bones platform that allows you to create virtual clusters, namespaces, and streamline independent workflows all within team assigned clusters through Role Based Access Control (RBAC). 

Additionally, much of the workflow is abstracted, allowing developers to interface with a GUI, rather than work through the command line in order to get their partitioned namespace up and running.

Ohana allows you to use and build a bespoke Internal Kubernetes Platform tailored to your company's needs at scale, providing the modularity needed to solve your business problems effectively and efficiently, even with limited time and reources.

Our Platform Generates:
- Cost Savings - the closest competitor costs $20/user per month
- Decreased Deployment Times - Self service models deploy 85% faster
- Independent Workflows - Creation of a separate virtual cluster results in fewer tickets
- Less Fricton Between Teams - Redefines roles and allows DevOps to focus on stability and Developers to focus on the code
- Increseased Productiviy - The more work accomplished, the larger the impact, the better the bottom line
